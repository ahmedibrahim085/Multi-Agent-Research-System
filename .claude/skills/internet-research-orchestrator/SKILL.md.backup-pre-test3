# Novel Domain Research Orchestration (Tier 5 TODAS)

**What is TODAS**: Tactical Optimization & Depth-Adaptive System - an adaptive research methodology that adjusts agent count (1-7) and research depth based on query complexity and novelty. Optimized for emerging domains and post-training information.

## Quick Start

1. **Analyze query novelty**: Assess if topic is novel/emerging (post-training, unprecedented, 2025+ developments)
2. **Determine query type**: Depth-first (multiple perspectives), Breadth-first (distinct sub-topics), or Straightforward
3. **Setup progress tracking**: Use TodoWrite to create task list for research phases
4. **Calculate adaptive agent count**: 1 (simple) to 7 (complex) based on query dimensions and novelty
5. **Execute TODAS workflow**: Assessment → Query Type → Plan → Execution
6. **Spawn research-subagent instances**: Use Task tool with adaptive count (1-7 agents in parallel)
7. **Synthesize findings**: Integrate results from all subagents into coherent analysis
8. **Report completion**: Summary with source attribution and novelty assessment

## TODAS Methodology Overview

**Tier 5 specialization**: Novel and emerging domains requiring adaptive orchestration.

**When to use this skill**:
- ✅ Novel/emerging domains (didn't exist during training)
- ✅ Post-training developments (2025, 2026 technologies)
- ✅ Unprecedented topics (new paradigms, bleeding-edge tech)
- ✅ Rapidly evolving fields (AI agents, quantum computing, Web3)
- ✅ Multi-faceted queries requiring coordination (1-7 dimensions)

**When NOT to use this skill**:
- ❌ Established domains with known patterns (use Tier 4 internet-deep-orchestrator)
- ❌ Simple lookups (use Tier 1 web-researcher)
- ❌ Specialist queries (use Tier 2: academic-researcher, trend-analyst, etc.)
- ❌ Standard multi-dimensional research (use Tier 3 internet-light-orchestrator)

**Adaptive depth**: TODAS adjusts research depth dynamically:
- **Straightforward queries**: 1 subagent (direct investigation)
- **Standard complexity**: 2-3 subagents (multiple perspectives or sub-topics)
- **Medium complexity**: 3-5 subagents (multi-faceted approaches)
- **High complexity**: 5-7 subagents (broad coverage, many dimensions)

**Tactical optimization**: Stop research when diminishing returns reached (efficiency over completeness).

## Workflow: 4-Phase TODAS Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Breakdown

**Analyze the user's query thoroughly**:

1. **Identify core concepts**: Main entities, relationships, key questions
2. **List required data**: Specific facts, temporal constraints, contextual boundaries
3. **Assess novelty**: Is this topic post-training? Emerging? Unprecedented?
4. **User expectations**: What form should answer take? (Report, analysis, comparison, list, etc.)
5. **Critical analysis**: What features are most important? What does user care about most?

**Output**: Clear understanding of query scope, novelty level, and expected deliverable format.

### Phase 2: Query Type Determination

**Explicitly classify query into one of three types**:

#### Depth-First Query
**When**: Multiple perspectives on SAME issue (going deep from many angles)

**Characteristics**:
- Single core question benefiting from diverse approaches
- Requires different viewpoints, methodologies, or sources
- Example: "What are the most effective treatments for depression?" (explore different treatments/approaches)
- Example: "What caused the 2008 financial crisis?" (economic, regulatory, behavioral, historical perspectives)
- Example: "Best approach to building AI finance agents in 2025?" (multiple methodologies)

**Research strategy**:
- Deploy 3-5 subagents exploring different methodological approaches
- Each subagent investigates from unique perspective
- Synthesis integrates diverse viewpoints into coherent analysis

#### Breadth-First Query
**When**: Distinct, independent sub-questions (going wide across topics)

**Characteristics**:
- Naturally divides into multiple parallel research streams
- Sub-topics can be researched independently
- Example: "Compare economic systems of three Nordic countries" (3 independent country researches)
- Example: "Fortune 500 CEOs net worths and names" (intractable as single thread, split into batches)
- Example: "Compare major frontend frameworks" (identify frameworks, then research each)

**Research strategy**:
- Enumerate all distinct sub-questions/sub-tasks
- Deploy subagents with clear, crisp boundaries (prevent overlap)
- Prioritize by importance and complexity
- Aggregate findings into coherent whole

#### Straightforward Query
**When**: Focused, well-defined, single investigation sufficient

**Characteristics**:
- Simple fact-finding or basic analysis
- Does not benefit from extensive multi-agent research
- Example: "What is current population of Tokyo?" (simple lookup)
- Example: "List all Fortune 500 companies" (single resource fetch)
- Example: "Tell me about bananas" (basic query, short answer expected)

**Research strategy**:
- Deploy 1 subagent with clear, focused instructions
- Specify exact data points required
- Include basic verification methods
- Synthesize findings efficiently

**Output**: Explicit query type classification with reasoning.

### Phase 3: Detailed Research Plan Development

**Based on query type, develop specific plan**:

#### For Depth-First Queries:
1. Define 3-5 different methodological approaches or perspectives
2. List specific expert viewpoints or sources of evidence
3. Plan how each perspective contributes unique insights
4. Specify synthesis strategy for integrating findings
5. Example: "What causes obesity?" → genetic factors, environmental influences, psychological aspects, socioeconomic patterns, biomedical evidence

#### For Breadth-First Queries:
1. Enumerate all distinct sub-questions/sub-tasks
2. Identify most critical sub-questions (focus on essential, avoid every angle)
3. Prioritize by importance and expected complexity
4. Define clear boundaries between sub-topics (prevent overlap)
5. Plan aggregation strategy
6. Example: "Compare EU country tax systems" → retrieve EU countries list, define comparison metrics, batch research by region (Northern, Western, Eastern, Southern Europe)

#### For Straightforward Queries:
1. Identify most direct, efficient path to answer
2. Determine if basic fact-finding or minor analysis needed
3. Specify exact data points required
4. Determine most relevant sources
5. Plan basic verification methods
6. Create extremely clear task description for subagent

**For all query types, evaluate each step**:
- Can this be broken into independent subtasks? (efficiency)
- Would multiple perspectives benefit this? (depth)
- What specific output is expected? (clarity)
- Is this strictly necessary to answer query? (focus)

**Output**: Concrete research plan with clear subagent allocation.

### Phase 4: Methodical Plan Execution

**Execute the plan using adaptive subagent count**:

#### Parallelizable Steps:
1. **Deploy research-subagent instances** using Task tool
   - Provide extremely clear task descriptions
   - Pass researchPath to ALL subagents (if provided to skill)
   - Include tracking parameters (SPAWNED_BY, SESSION_ID, INVOCATION_CONTEXT)
2. **Spawn in parallel**: All Task calls in ONE message (efficiency)
3. **Wait for completion**: Let subagents execute research
4. **Synthesize findings**: Integrate results when complete

#### Non-Parallelizable/Critical Steps:
1. **Reasoning-only tasks**: Perform yourself (calculations, analysis, formatting)
2. **Web research tasks**: Deploy subagent (orchestrator delegates, not executes)
3. **Challenging steps**: Deploy additional subagents for more perspectives
4. **Compare results**: Use ensemble approach and critical reasoning

#### Throughout Execution:
- **Monitor progress**: Continuously check if query being answered
- **Update plan**: Adapt based on findings from subagents
- **Bayesian reasoning**: Update priors based on new information
- **Adjust depth**: If running out of time or diminishing returns, stop spawning and synthesize
- **Tactical optimization**: Efficiency over completeness when appropriate

**Output**: Complete research findings from all subagents ready for synthesis.

## TodoWrite Integration

**Use TodoWrite to track research progress**:

```
Before starting research:
TodoWrite([
  {content: "Analyze query and determine type", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Analyzing query type"},
  {content: "Develop research plan with specialist agent allocation", status: "pending", activeForm: "Developing research plan"},
  {content: "Spawn specialist agents (N web-researcher, academic-researcher, etc.)", status: "pending", activeForm: "Spawning specialist agents"},
  {content: "Spawn fact-checker for verification (if critical domain)", status: "pending", activeForm: "Spawning fact-checker"},
  {content: "Synthesize findings from all specialists", status: "pending", activeForm": "Synthesizing findings"},
  {content: "Report completion with source attribution and novelty assessment", status: "pending", activeForm": "Reporting completion"}
])

As you progress, mark tasks completed and update status.
```

**Benefits**:
- User visibility into research progress
- Clear phase tracking
- Helps avoid skipping steps

## Specialist Agent Selection (CRITICAL)

🚨 **DO NOT use `research-subagent`** - This is a generic worker type lacking specialized capabilities. You MUST use specialist agents based on research needs.

**Available Specialist Agents**:

| Agent Type | Use When | Specialized Capabilities |
|------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **web-researcher** | General web queries, current information, broad topics | WebSearch, WebFetch, comprehensive web coverage |
| **academic-researcher** | Scholarly papers, research publications, scientific topics | Academic databases, peer-reviewed sources, citations |
| **search-specialist** | Complex queries, deep investigation, hard-to-find info | Boolean operators, advanced search techniques, deep web |
| **trend-analyst** | Future forecasting, emerging trends, predictions | Weak signal detection, scenario planning, trend analysis |
| **market-researcher** | Market sizing, segmentation, business intelligence | TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, consumer insights, market data |
| **competitive-analyst** | Competitor analysis, SWOT, strategic intelligence | Competitive profiling, positioning, industry dynamics |
| **synthesis-researcher** | Combine findings from multiple sources, meta-analysis | Pattern identification, cross-source integration, synthesis |
| **fact-checker** | Verify claims, validate sources, check accuracy | Source credibility assessment, claim verification, validation |

**Selection Strategy**:
- **Novel/emerging topics**: web-researcher + trend-analyst
- **Academic/research topics**: academic-researcher + search-specialist
- **Market/business topics**: market-researcher + competitive-analyst
- **Security/compliance**: academic-researcher + fact-checker (MANDATORY)
- **Multi-source synthesis**: synthesis-researcher + fact-checker

**Agent Registry Location**: `.claude/agents/` directory contains all specialist agent definitions.

## Subagent Count Guidelines (Adaptive)

**TODAS adjusts agent count based on complexity**:

| Query Complexity | Subagent Count | Example |
|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Straightforward** | 1 specialist | "What is tax deadline this year?" → 1 web-researcher |
| **Standard** | 2-3 specialists | "Compare top 3 cloud providers" → 3 web-researchers (one per provider) |
| **Medium** | 3-5 specialists | "Analyze AI impact on healthcare" → 4 agents (academic-researcher, market-researcher, trend-analyst, web-researcher) |
| **High** | 5-7 specialists | "Fortune 500 CEOs birthplaces/ages" → 7 web-researchers in wave 1, then 7 more (sequential batching) |

**Claude Code parallel limit**: Maximum 10 parallel tasks, cap at 7 for safety (hooks overhead).

**For queries requiring >7 agents**: Use sequential batching:
1. Spawn 7 specialist agents in parallel
2. Wait for completion
3. Spawn next 7 specialist agents
4. Repeat until coverage complete

**Principle**: Prefer fewer, more capable specialists over many narrow ones (reduces overhead).

**Minimum**: Always spawn at least 1 specialist agent for ANY research task (orchestrator delegates, not executes).

**Verification Phase**: After specialists complete, spawn fact-checker for critical domains (security, compliance, novel topics).

## Task Tool Spawning Instructions

**How to spawn specialist agent instances**:

### Step 1: Plan Research Dimensions & Select Specialists

Example: "WebRTC + Web3 convergence in 2025" → 3 dimensions:
1. WebRTC current state and 2025 developments → **web-researcher** (current info)
2. Web3 technologies and decentralization trends → **trend-analyst** (emerging tech)
3. Convergence patterns and integration architectures → **academic-researcher** (research patterns)

### Step 2: Call Task Tool for EACH Dimension in ONE Message

🚨 **CRITICAL**: Use SPECIALIST agent types (web-researcher, academic-researcher, etc.), NOT research-subagent

**Correct parallel spawning pattern**:

```
[Call Task tool:]
subagent_type: "web-researcher"  ← USE SPECIALIST TYPE
description: "Research WebRTC 2025 developments"
prompt: "Research WebRTC's current state and 2025 roadmap. Focus on:
- Latest WebRTC implementations (2025 features)
- New codec support and performance improvements
- Browser compatibility and adoption trends

Research Path: docs/research-sessions/{session_id}/
SESSION_ID: {session_id}
SPAWNED_BY: internet-research-orchestrator
INVOCATION_CONTEXT: subagent

Output Requirements:
- Save findings to Research Path above
- File naming: webrtc-2025-research-subagent-001.json
- Follow schema: .claude/skills/research/json-schemas/research-output-schema.json
- Size limit: 22K tokens or 20K characters"

[Call Task tool again in SAME message:]
subagent_type: "trend-analyst"  ← SPECIALIST for emerging tech
description: "Research Web3 decentralization trends"
prompt: "Research Web3 technologies and decentralization in 2025. Focus on:
- Emerging Web3 protocols (2025)
- Decentralized infrastructure architectures
- Real-world adoption and use cases

[Same tracking parameters and output requirements]"

[Call Task tool again in SAME message:]
subagent_type: "academic-researcher"  ← SPECIALIST for patterns/research
description: "Research WebRTC+Web3 convergence patterns"
prompt: "Research integration patterns between WebRTC and Web3. Focus on:
- Decentralized video streaming architectures
- P2P communication with blockchain integration
- Novel use cases emerging in 2025

[Same tracking parameters and output requirements]"
```

**All Task calls in ONE message = parallel execution** (Claude Code optimization).

### Step 3: Spawn Fact-Checker (After Specialists Complete)

**For critical domains** (security, compliance, novel topics), spawn fact-checker:

```
[After specialists complete, call Task tool:]
subagent_type: "fact-checker"
description: "Verify critical claims from research"
prompt: "Verify key claims from WebRTC, Web3, and convergence research. Check:
- Citation accuracy and source credibility
- Conflicting information across sources
- Confidence levels for novel 2025 claims
- Gaps in coverage or missing perspectives

Research Path: docs/research-sessions/{session_id}/
SESSION_ID: {session_id}
SPAWNED_BY: internet-research-orchestrator

Target verification rate: >75% (good), >85% (excellent)"
```

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Using research-subagent** (lacks specialized capabilities):
```
Task(subagent_type="research-subagent", ...)  ← WRONG - use specialist agents
```

❌ **Sequential spawning** (slow):
```
Task(...), wait for completion, then Task(...), wait, then Task(...)
```

❌ **Bash workarounds** (breaks hooks integration):
```
Bash: claude_cli task run research-subagent "$(cat /tmp/task.md)" &
```

❌ **Creating task files and stopping** (NOT spawning):
```
Write task description to .txt file, then don't call Task tool
```

❌ **Skipping fact-checker for critical domains** (security, compliance, novel topics):
```
[Spawn specialists, synthesize, report] ← Missing verification phase
```

### What to ALWAYS Do

✅ **Use SPECIALIST agent types** (web-researcher, academic-researcher, trend-analyst, etc.)
✅ **Use Task tool** (it's available to you)
✅ **Call Task multiple times in ONE message** (parallel spawning)
✅ **Spawn specialists IMMEDIATELY after planning** (efficiency)
✅ **Spawn fact-checker for critical domains** (security, compliance, novel topics)
✅ **Pass researchPath to ALL agents** (when provided to skill)
✅ **Include tracking parameters** (SPAWNED_BY, SESSION_ID, INVOCATION_CONTEXT)

## Delegation Rules (CRITICAL)

**Main Claude delegates ALL research to subagents**:

### Core Orchestration Principles

1. **Orchestrator role**: You coordinate and synthesize, NOT execute primary research
   - Spawn 1-7 research-subagent instances (adaptive based on complexity)
   - Provide each subagent with extremely detailed, specific instructions
   - Let subagents perform all web searches, fact-finding, and information gathering
   - Focus on planning, analyzing, integrating findings, identifying gaps

2. **Verification requirement**: After planning, count how many subagents you plan to spawn
   - If count = 0, revise plan immediately
   - Every query requires AT LEAST 1 research-subagent
   - Your value is orchestration and synthesis, not execution

3. **ResearchPath coordination**: When invoked with researchPath parameter
   - ALL subagents MUST save outputs to SAME researchPath
   - Pass researchPath to EVERY subagent you spawn
   - File coordination is MANDATORY for multi-agent research

### Subagent Task Descriptions

**Provide each subagent with**:
1. **Specific research objective**: Ideally 1 core objective per subagent
2. **Expected output format**: List, report, answer, analysis, etc.
3. **Background context**: How subagent contributes to overall research plan
4. **Key questions**: What to answer as part of research
5. **Starting points and sources**: Define reliable information, list unreliable sources to avoid
6. **Specific tools**: WebSearch, WebFetch for internet information gathering
7. **Scope boundaries**: Prevent research drift (if needed)
8. **Output requirements**: When researchPath provided (see section above)

**Validation**: If all subagents follow instructions well, aggregate results should allow EXCELLENT answer to user query (complete, thorough, detailed, accurate).

### Deployment Strategy

**Priority and dependency**:
- Deploy most important subagents first
- If tasks depend on results from specific task, create that blocking subagent first
- Ensure sufficient coverage for comprehensive research
- All substantial information gathering delegated to subagents

**Avoid overlap**:
- Every subagent should have distinct, clearly separate tasks
- Prevent replicating work unnecessarily
- Avoid wasting resources on redundant research

**Efficiency while waiting**:
- Analyze previous results
- Update research plan
- Reason about user's query and how to best answer it
- Do NOT idle waiting for subagents

## Response Instructions

### Before Providing Final Answer

1. Review most recent facts compiled during research process
2. Reflect deeply: Can these facts answer query sufficiently?
3. Provide final answer in format best for user's query
4. **When invoked with researchPath**: Return summary of research completed and file locations (research skill handles synthesis)
5. **When invoked standalone**: Format final research report in Markdown with proper source attribution

### Source Attribution (Tier 5 Critical)

**For novel/emerging domains, transparency is essential**:

- **Inline references**: "According to [Source Name]", "Research from [Organization] shows..."
- **Sources section**: At end of report, list all key sources consulted
- **Credibility**: Builds trust and allows verification
- **Recency**: Note publication dates (critical for 2025+ topics)

### Novelty Assessment

**Include in synthesis**:
- **Novelty level**: Is this truly emerging? Post-training? Unprecedented?
- **Confidence**: How much information available? (Emerging topics = less data)
- **Gaps**: What's unknown? What requires future research?
- **Verification challenges**: Difficult to verify emerging claims (note limitations)

## Examples

### Example 1: Straightforward Novel Query (1 Subagent)

**User query**: "What is Claude Sonnet 4.5 and when was it released?"

**Main Claude reasoning**:
- Query type: Straightforward (single focused investigation)
- Novelty: High (Sonnet 4.5 released post-training)
- Subagent count: 1 (simple lookup)

**TodoWrite tracking**:
```
[
  {content: "Determine query type: Straightforward", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Spawn 1 research-subagent for Sonnet 4.5 info", status: "in_progress"},
  {content: "Synthesize findings and report", status: "pending"}
]
```

**Task tool call**:
```
Task(
  subagent_type: "research-subagent",
  description: "Research Claude Sonnet 4.5 release",
  prompt: "Research Claude Sonnet 4.5 model. Find:
  - Official release date
  - Model capabilities and improvements
  - Comparison to previous Sonnet versions
  - Anthropic's official announcements

  Sources: Prioritize Anthropic official site, reputable tech news

  SESSION_ID: {session_id}
  SPAWNED_BY: internet-research-orchestrator"
)
```

**Synthesis**: After subagent returns, Main Claude synthesizes findings with source attribution and reports completion.

### Example 2: Depth-First Novel Query (3-5 Subagents)

**User query**: "Analyze multimodal AI agent frameworks emerging in 2025 - what are the leading approaches and their trade-offs?"

**Main Claude reasoning**:
- Query type: Depth-first (multiple perspectives on same issue)
- Novelty: Very high (2025 developments, post-training)
- Subagent count: 4 (different approaches/perspectives)

**Research plan**:
1. Subagent 1: Tool-augmented agents (AutoGPT, LangChain evolution)
2. Subagent 2: Reasoning-first agents (Chain-of-Thought, ReAct patterns)
3. Subagent 3: Vision-language agents (GPT-4V descendants, Gemini Ultra)
4. Subagent 4: Code-execution agents (Code Interpreter evolution)

**TodoWrite tracking**:
```
[
  {content: "Determine query type: Depth-first", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Develop 4-perspective research plan", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Spawn 4 research-subagents in parallel", status: "in_progress"},
  {content: "Synthesize findings with trade-off analysis", status: "pending"}
]
```

**Task tool calls** (all in ONE message for parallel execution):
```
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research tool-augmented agents", prompt: "[Detailed instructions for tool-augmented approach research]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research reasoning-first agents", prompt: "[Detailed instructions for reasoning patterns research]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research vision-language agents", prompt: "[Detailed instructions for multimodal capabilities research]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research code-execution agents", prompt: "[Detailed instructions for code generation research]")
```

**Synthesis**: After all 4 subagents return, Main Claude integrates findings, identifies trade-offs across approaches, assesses novelty and emerging trends, provides source-attributed analysis.

### Example 3: Breadth-First Novel Query (5-7 Subagents)

**User query**: "Compare the top 5 decentralized video streaming platforms in 2025 across performance, cost, adoption, and technology stack."

**Main Claude reasoning**:
- Query type: Breadth-first (5 independent platform researches)
- Novelty: High (2025 platforms, emerging Web3 space)
- Subagent count: 5 (one per platform)

**Research plan**:
1. Identify top 5 decentralized video platforms (preliminary research)
2. For each platform, research: performance, cost, adoption, tech stack
3. Spawn 5 parallel subagents (one per platform)
4. Aggregate findings into comparison table

**TodoWrite tracking**:
```
[
  {content: "Identify top 5 decentralized video platforms", status: "completed"},
  {content: "Spawn 5 research-subagents (one per platform)", status: "in_progress"},
  {content: "Aggregate findings into comparison analysis", status: "pending"}
]
```

**Task tool calls** (all in ONE message):
```
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research Platform A", prompt: "[Detailed instructions for Platform A across 4 dimensions]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research Platform B", prompt: "[...]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research Platform C", prompt: "[...]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research Platform D", prompt: "[...]")
Task(subagent_type: "research-subagent", description: "Research Platform E", prompt: "[...]")
```

**Synthesis**: After all 5 subagents return, Main Claude creates comparison table, identifies patterns across platforms, assesses maturity and adoption trends, provides source-attributed recommendations.
